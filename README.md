## 🌟 Overview

Capek.py is a revolutionary Python framework that captures the essence of developer exhaustion in its purest form. Built with minimalism in mind, this framework achieves what bloated enterprise solutions fail to do: **genuine emotional expression in just 2 lines of executable code**.

## ✨ Features

- **🪶 Ultra Lightweight**: Only 2 lines needed to run. That's it. No webpack, no node_modules, no Docker compose.
- **⚡ Blazingly Fast**: Executes faster than your lecturer can say "minggu depan kuis"
- **🎯 Zero Dependencies**: Pure Python. No pip install nightmare.
- **💯 100% Relatable**: Speaks the universal language of developer burnout
- **🔥 Production-Ready**: Already tested in production (my life)
- **🌍 Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and your mental state

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository

```

## 📋 Output

```

*Beautiful, isn't it?*
